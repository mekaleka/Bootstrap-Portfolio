# Bootstrap-Portfolio
On this assignment I created a portfolio using Bootstrap. I used css styling to chang some elements that was pre-defined in bootstrap. I had trouble with this assignment at first as I kept trying to use css instead of bootstrap's pre-defined stylesheet. I was able to combine the bootstrap's css and some of my own css to create my page. 

Here is the link to my Bootstrap Portfolio on GitHub:
